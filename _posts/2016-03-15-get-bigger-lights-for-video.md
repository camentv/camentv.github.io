Lighting is soooo important! In a previous article I talked about buying this discount lighting package, but it was so damn dim — I had to return it. It was ridiculous. It barely lit my arm. I’d have been better off with a flashlight from the Dollar Store. 

This really has been a journey for me. I have never had to light a set or operate a camera in my life. I'm usually just the talent. I go in and the director and crew, who are all professionals, take care of everything — lights, camera, makeup, etc. All I usually have to worry about is knowing my lines and making sure my performance is the best I can make it. 

So, I sent back the weak ass light and went big. Luckily they had a great return policy and I saved the box and originally packaging. Always save your original packaging and receipts!

You must light the scene correctly. My friend Barrie, who is a high-end photographer and filmmaker, got on my case when I told him what I ordered. He told me what to get so I could stay worry free when it came to lighting. I ended up getting a LED 1020 light with bi-color so I have a full spectrum of color. It is goes from daylight to WAY BRIGHT. It's a monster light. I love it. 

Finally, I got to start making videos with all this technical stuff out of the way. Now I can concentrate on giving the audience my best performance. Heck, I almost feel like a Ronco Showtime Rotisserie — Set it and Forget it! Or Set me and Forget me!
