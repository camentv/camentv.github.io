summary:    Actually, it's hard to be a snob when you're on a budget. :) But I still wanted a good condenser mic for my new DSLR. Here's why I chose Shure instead of Rode.

I’m attempting to get a good clean audio track when recording in enclosed environments. I want to minimize noise and make the best possible audio for my comedy videos so of course everyone can understand me without resorting to using subtitles. 

I went with the Shure VP83 LensHopper Camera-Mount Condenser Microphone. Shure is a solid brand name and the company has been around since 1925. They make quality microphones and that is a fact.

  I didn’t go with the Rode Videomic because quite frankly it’s plastic and feels like it would break in my hand. Since I’m a veteran professional voice actor (check out my voice acting page <a href="http://www.voicecomic.com/" target="new">here</a>) and I’ve worked on shows like The Smurfs, Skylanders video games and others, I like good crisp clean audio. I wanted a name brand that wasn’t too expensive, and had a good reputation. In my home recording studio I use the Sennheiser 416 and the Neumann TLM-49 — top of the line microphones. So I wanted something good to mount on my camera.

Neumann doesn’t make microphones for my small camera. In order for me to get the quality of audio I’m used to. I went with the Shure VP83 LensHopper. It’s covered in metal and has a better sound quality IMHO. It was a hundred bucks more than the Rode I was looking at, but I want to invest in quality.

As a professional voice actor, audio is important to me and with Shure I’m sure I made a good choice. And being sure about Shure I’m sure I will have this microphone for years to come. I’m almost Shure of it, I mean … sure of it. :)
