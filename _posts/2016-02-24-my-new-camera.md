summary:    After deciding to go with a DLSR camera (and dealing with a bunch of craigslist flakers) I finally got a new camera to film my videos! Read about it here.

As a stand up comedian, I’m doing my best to bring to YouTube high-quality videos of my comedy routines and characters I’ve done over the years in comedy clubs and other venues. I'm also creating new content with new characters and situations. I want to make people laugh and make people think — and reach a new global audience. 

I bought a Panasonic Lumix DMC-G7 4K because it seems to be very user friendly. I wanted the latest technology and highest quality video possible without spending an arm and a leg or even a few fingers. So far, it’s been a great camera.

I had no luck on buying a “pre-owned” camera on craigslist! The people seemed to flake out on me even after speaking to them on the phone even though they seemed nice and we agreed to meet. I say you should buy new even though it may cost a few bucks more. You get a warranty; and we all like guarantees.   

I wanted a mirrorless camera because it seems to be the trend where technology is going. I feel this is a good choice over other DSLR cameras out there and I will have this camera for years before I need or want to upgrade. That was part of the reason why I got it. 

Video is my primary application. I am not going to be shooting wildlife, or anything. It's great so far, and I'm glad I bought it new instead of used. 

The Panasonic Lumix DMC-G7 4K — it won’t break your piggy bank unless you’re broke. That's what I went with instead of the Canon. sAnd if you are broke or still paying off school loans or whatever, then get a loan from Mom or Dad or your shady Uncle or cousin Bruno. :)  They may charge interest, but it’s worth it!
