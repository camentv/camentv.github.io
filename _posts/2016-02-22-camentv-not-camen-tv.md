Hey everybody! This is the first post on my shiny new website.

Some people are telling me they can't find me on youtube, but that's because they are typing in "Camen TV" which is wrong! :) ... there is no space in there. It's spelled like this:

## <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9NhO5pUIptr-8m0VRvZPag">CamenTV</a>

So now ya know! :)

So, I ordered a new camera and some new lights. My cell phone was taking decent video, but I am trying to up my game and get you guys better quality. I'm also thinking about getting a microphone for the camera that attaches to the top.

You guys know that I do voice acting, so the audio is quality is important to me. I also like microphones. So I am thinking about getting a good one for the camera. 

that's all for now!

sincerely, 

— Joey
