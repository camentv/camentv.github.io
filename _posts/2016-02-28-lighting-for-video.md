summary:    I'm trying to keep things simple. I also like a good bargain. In this case, I got the wrong type of lighting at first, but now I'm happy with what I got. Read about my saga learning about lighting for video.

In order to bring out the highest quality, I’m lighting the areas where I shoot video. I am trying to give them more professional production values. I want to give my YouTube performances a better look and feel — as if I were on a movie set or sound stage. 

This is my first time ever trying to light a video shoot. I am accustomed to being filmed, but I never had to set anything up!

I ending up buying an easy to put together StudioPRO 1050W Auto Pop-up Softbox 20 Inch Light Kit from a company called Fovitec in Irvine, CA. Not too far from my home. Based on reviews, they seemed to have a good reputation and good customer service. And most importantly they ship quickly!

Again, Craigslist seems to be ripping people off by selling the same lighting kits at the same prices as large superstores like Amazon and sometimes for even more money. Ludicrous.

However, I did buy a lighting kit from a guy that was an exception to most of the craigslist flakes I encountered. The lights were made in West Germany and well built. But even after testing it at his place, when I got it home the lights didn’t hold their brightness for some reason. So I ordered the new kit from Fovitec. On the bright side, I have an extra set of light stands made out of steel, not aluminum. 

I looked for a light kit that was small, powerful and easy to set up. I also wanted one that had energy saving bulbs and didn’t cost 1000s of dollars. Both light boxes I got put out 1000 watts, which is all I need right now. And I wanted a warranty.

Things happen for a reason. Now I know to not buy used electrical stuff off craigslist unless I’m looking to waste time and money and gas. No. I think I’ll stick to new and warranties, unless it’s being sold by Angelina Jolie. :)
